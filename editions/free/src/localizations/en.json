    "ABOUT_WHAT_IS": "What is MartyBlocks Jr?",
    "ABOUT_DESCRIPTION": "Based on the ScratchJr interface, we developed an introductory programming language which uses Marty the Robot to enable young children (ages 5-7) to develop their computational thinking. Similar to MartyBlocks (which is based on Scratch and aimed at children aged 8+), children can create interactive stories and games, though MartyBlocks Jr has been altered to cater for younger children, and the features have been carefully crafted matching children's cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.  <br/><br/> Children can snap together colorful programming blocks to make their Marty sprite walk, dance, wave, eyebrow-wiggle and make noises. In addition (and perhaps most importantly), children can connect their real-life Marty the Robot to the app, so Marty can come to life both on and off the screen! MartyBlocks Jr differs from any other introductory programming platform in that you see your Marty sprite from a birds-eye view, with motion blocks mimicking Marty’s movements in the real world. <br/><br/> MartyBlocks Jr features several unique backgrounds (including Mars!), so children can go wild, dive deep into their imaginations and take Marty on amazing adventures. Children can use the paint editor tool to draw/modify the backgrounds and even adapt Marty and bring a unique personality to their Marty sprite. So bring some imagination to your screen and why not turn Marty pink or add a cowboy hat and journey back in time to an old western scene?",
    "ABOUT_WHY_CREATE": "Why Did We Create MartyBlocks Jr?",
    "ABOUT_WHY_CREATE_DESCRIPTION": "Learning to code from a young age can help set up children for success. Coding not only helps improve computational thinking but can vastly improve numerous skills, including mathematical and writing skills, along with valuable communication skills in life and the 21st century workplace. At Robotical, our goal is for coding to be accessible and exciting for everyone, no matter their age, gender or location.   <br/><br/> ScratchJr was developed as a simplified version of its “brother” platform, Scratch. MartyBlocks Jr was developed to create the same learning progression, creating a learning ladder so younger children can also learn these vital skills, even before they are able to read.",
    "ABOUT_WHO_CREATED": "Who is Robotical?",
    "ABOUT_WHO_CREATED_DESCRIPTION": "In 2016, Dr Alexander (Sandy) Enoch set up Robotical with the vision of creating a human-like robot, full of character, to help teach children the basics of coding in a fun and exciting way. Today Marty is more than a dream and this small blue and yellow humanoid can be found moving and grooving in over 1,000 schools around the world. <br/><br/> MartyBlocks Jr was created by Robotical's product and development team, led by Siobhan Duncan and Finlay Page.",
